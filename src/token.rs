/// identifier that is used to identify the "owner" of an allocation.
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// In order for an allocation group to be attached to an allocation, it must be "entered." [`AllocationGroupToken`]
/// functions similarly to something like a mutex, where "entering" the token conumes the token and provides a guard:
/// [`AllocationGuard`].  This guard is tied to the allocation group being active: if the guard is dropped, or if it is
/// exited manually, the allocation group is no longer active.
///
/// [`AllocationGuard`] also tracks if another allocation group was active prior to entering, and ensures it is set back
/// as the active allocation group when the guard is dropped.  This allows allocation groups to be nested within each
/// other.

    /// exhausted.  On 64-bit systems, this limit is 2^64.

/// group in a specialized `tracing_subscriber` layer that we control.
