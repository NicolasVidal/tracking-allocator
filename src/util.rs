/// `PhantomNotSend` is designed to do one simple thing: make a struct unable to be sent across
/// threads, aka `!Send`.  Normal Rust code cannot implement negatrve trait bounds like the standard
/// library can, but there's one simple trick that doctors hate: stuffing your struct with a
/// pointer.
///
/// Pointers are `!Send` and `!Sync` by default, so adding one to a struct also makes that struct
/// `!Send`/`!Sync`.  We don't have an actual pointer, we just fake it with PhantomData. ðŸ‘»
///
/// `AllocationGuard` cannot be allowed to be sent across threads, as doing so would violate the
/// invariant that we drop our allocation group from the active allocation group TLS variable when
/// the guard drops or is exited.  If we did not enforce this, we would trash the thread-local data,
/// and allocations would not be associated correctly.
///
/// Specifically, though, we're fine with `AllocationGuard` being `Sync`, as it has no inherent
/// methods that can be used in such a way.  We implement `Sync` for `PhantomNotSend` as it has no
/// API anyways.
